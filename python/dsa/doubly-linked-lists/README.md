# Doubly Linked Lists
**Doubly linked** lists are a type of linked list where each node contains a **reference the the next node as well as the previous node**.

The main advantage in the **doubly linked list** over **singly linked list**, is that the **list** can be traversed both `forward` and `backward`.
