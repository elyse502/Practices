# Doubly Linked Lists
**Doubly linked** lists are a type of linked list where each node contains a **reference the the next node as well as the previous node**.

The main advantage in the **doubly linked list** over **singly linked list**, is that the **list** can be traversed both `forward` and `backward`.

## Structure of a `Doubly Linked List`

## Time Complexity of Doubly Linked Lists Operations
1. Insertion at the beginning (**prepend**): `O(1)`
2. Insertion at the end (**append**): `O(1)`
3. Insertion at a specific position: `O(n)`
4. Deletion from the beginning: `(O(1)`
5. Deletion from the end: `O(1)`
6. Deletion from a specific position: `O(n)`
7. Searching for a specific element: `O(n)`
