# Tree Traversal
**Tree traversal** refers to the process of visiting each `node` in a `tree data structure`, covering all the `nodes` in a `specific order`.

## Types of Tree Traversal Algorithms
* **Breadth First Search** (BFS): The `breadth first search algorithm` explores a `tree` level by level, starting from the `root` and moving horizontally across the `levels`.
* **Depth First Search** (DFS): The `depth first search` explores a `tree` by going as deep as possible along one `branch` before backtracking.

When it comes to **tree traversal**, `depth first search` is a very common `traversal algorithm`, and there are mainly 3 types of `depth first search` **tree traversal algorithms**:
1. **In-order traversal**: Visit the `left subtree` first, then visit the `root node`, then visit the `right subtree`.
2. **Pre-order traversal**: Visit the `root node` first, then visit the `left subtree`, then visit the `right subtree`.
3. **Post-order traversal**: Visit the `left subtree` first, then visit the `right subtree`, then visit the `root node`.
