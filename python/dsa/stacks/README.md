# Stacks
A **stack** is a data structure that stores a collection of elements following **last-in-first-out** (`LIFO`) **principle**.

Let's imagine a real life analogy to understand how **stacks** work. Let's say you're in a restaurant and there is a **stack** of plates put on a table. This **stack** of plates is similar to how the **stack** data structure works. When a new plate is added, it's added to the top of the stack, and each time someone takes a plate, they always take the one from the top of the **stack** or the last added plate, and hence comes the name **last-in-first-out** or `LIFO` principle.

* Adding an `item` to the **stack** data structure is called `push`, and removing an `item` is called `pop`.
* A common example of using a **stack** in `computer science` is the **undo**(C-z) feature in a `text editor`.
