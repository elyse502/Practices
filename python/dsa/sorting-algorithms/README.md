# Bubble Sort
**Bubble Sort** is a straightforward **sorting algorithm** that works by comparing `adjacent elements` and swapping them if they are out of order. **Bubble Sort** is one of the simplest **sorting algorithms** out there.

# Insertion Sort
The idea behind the **insertion sort** is to divide the `array` into two parts, a `sorted` part and an `unsorted` part, and the **algorithm** iterates through the `unsorted` part and selects one `element` at a time and inserts it into its correct position in the `sorted` part.

* In the **insertion sort** we always start with the `second element` and assume that the `first element` is already sorted.

# Selection Sort
**Selection sort** is a simple **sorting algorithm** that sorts the array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the `unsorted` part and putting it at the beginning.

* In the beginning we consider the entire **list** as `unsorted`. Then we find the `minimum element` and swap it with the `first element`, and then the `first element` is considered `sorted`. So we repeat the same steps again, and swap the `minimum element` with the second element...
