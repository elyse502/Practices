# Big O Notation
**Big O Notation** refer to  the ability to measure the effieciency of a code or an algorithm based on the time it takes to run and the space it consumes in relation to the size of the input provided to it.

More concisely, we can say **Big O Notation** measures the efficiency of acode based on how their **run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.**

* Measuring the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute is called `Time Complexity`.
* Measuring the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the space it consumes to run is called `Space Complexity`.

## Linear Complexity or O(n)
**Linear Complexity** means that the space or the run time of an algorithm **scales proportionally with the input size**.

## Constant Complexity or O(1)
**Constant Complexity** means that the amount of time or space consumed by an algorithm **is constant and has no relation with the size of the input**.
