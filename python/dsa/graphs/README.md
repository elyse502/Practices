# Graphs
A **graph** is a collection of `nodes` or `vertices` and `edges` that connect **pairs** of `nodes`.

This is an example of a **graph**:



There are two types of **graphs**:
* **Directed** graphs: In a **directed graph** the `edges` have a direction indicating a one way relationship between a `node` and another in the **graph**.
    * An example of this is a social media apllication like **Instagram**, when you follow someone and they donn't follow you. So the relationship here is not **mutual**, it's a one way relationship.



* **Undirected** graphs: In the **undirected graphs**, the `edges` have no direction. That means that the relationship is **mutual**.
    * For example, in a social media application the people can be represented by the `nodes` of the **graph**, and if they are friends there will be an **undirected** `edge` between them.



**Graphs** can also be **weighted**, meaning that each `edge` in the **graph** has a numerical value that represents the **weight** of the `edge`. And that can be anything like the `distance`, the `cost`, it depends on the **graph**. An example of that can be a maps application like **`Google Maps`**, the `nodes` can be cities and the `edges` are the roads. In that case the `weights` of the `edges` can be the distance or the travel time between two districts or cities.
