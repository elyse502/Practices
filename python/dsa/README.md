# What are Data Structures?
**Data structures** are specialized formats for organizing and storing **data** to perform operations **efficiently**.

## Data can be:
* `Primitive Data Types`: integers, floats, characters, strings, etc.
* `Reference Data Types`: objects, arrays, and functions.

## Two categories of Data Structures:
| Linear Data Structures | Non-Linear Data Structures |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
|`Example`: arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. | `Example`: trees and graphs. |

# What are Algorithms?
An **algorithm** is a step-by-step set of **instructions** or a sequence of **operations** designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem.

## Types of Algorithms
> Searching, Sorting, Graph Algorithms, Tree Algorithms.
