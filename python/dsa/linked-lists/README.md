# Linked Lists
**Linked List** is a **collection of data elements** whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory, instead **each element points to the next**. In simple words a **linked list** is a `data structure` consisting of **nodes** where each **node** points to the next **node** in the sequence.

`Nodes` in **Linked List**, each node consists of two parts, the **data** the **link** that is pointing to the next node in the **linked list**. And the **link** in the last node is pointing to `null`, and the `head node` is always pointing to the `first node` in the **linked list**, and the `tail` is always pointing to the `last node`, and the `nodes` of the **linked list** are not stored in contiguous memory locations. That means they are randomly stored in the `memory`, and they are connected using the **links** in each `node`.
