# Linked Lists
**Linked List** is a **collection of data elements** whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory, instead **each element points to the next**.

Nodes in **Linked List**, each node consists of two parts, the data the link thet is pointing to the next node in the linked list. And the link in the last node is pointing to null, and the head node is always pointing to the first node in the linked list, and the tail is always pointing to the last node, and the nodes of the linked list are not stored in contiguous memory locations. That means they are randomly stored in the memory, and they are connected using the links in each node.
