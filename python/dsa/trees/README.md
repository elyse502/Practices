# Trees
A **tree** in computer science is a data structure that represents a **hierarchical tree structure** with a set of **connected nodes**. It mainly consists of `nodes` and **edges** that connect those `nodes`.

* In **trees**, `nodes` are connected in **`parent-child`** relationships.

* The `topmost` node in the **tree** is called the **root node**. And any `node` with no **children** is called a **leaf node**.

**Trees** are very common in computer science and used in many applications such as **file systems**.
