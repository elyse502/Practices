# Queues
A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the First-in-first-out or `FIFO` principle.

* The operation of adding a new **element** to the `queue` is called **enqueue**, and the **element** is added to the **back** of the `queue`, and the operation of removing an **element** from the `queue` is called **dequeue**, and the **element** is removed from the **front** of the `queue`.
