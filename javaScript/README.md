# JavaScript
## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world right now. It's a great opportunity to get a good job out of learning JavaScript. You can work as a front-end developer or a full stack developer who knows both the front end and the back end.

## What can you do with JavaScript?
For a long time, javascript was only used in browsers to build interactive web pages some developers refer to javascript as a toy language but those days are gone because of huge community support and investments by large companies like `Facebook` and `Google`, these days you can build full-blown web or mobile apps as well as real time networking applications like chats and video streaming services command-line tools or even games.

## Where does JavaScript code run?
JavaScript was originally designed to run only in browsers so every browser has what we call a `JavaScript engine` that can excute JavaScript code for example the JavaScript engines in `firefox` and `chrome` are **SpiderMonkey** and **v8**.

In 2009 a very clever engineer called **`Ryan Dahl`** took the open-source JavaScript engine in chrome and embedded it inside a `C++` program he called that program **`Node`**, the node is a `C++` program that includes Google's **`v8`** JavaScript engine. Now with this we can run **JavaScript** code out of a browser so we can pass our **JavaScript** code to `node` for the execution and this means with **JavaScript** we can build the `backend` for our web and mobile applications. 

In a nutshell **JavaScript** code can be run inside of a `browser` or in `node` browsers and `node` provide a runtime environment for our **JavaScript** code.

## What is the difference between `JavaScript` and `ECMAScript`?
Well `ECMAScript` is just a **specification** while `JavaScript` is a programming language that confirms to this **specification**. So we have this organization called `ECMA` which is responsible for defining standards for defining standards, they take care of this `ECMAScript` **specification**.

The first version os `ECMAScript` was released in 1997, then starting from 2015 **`ECMA`** has been working on annual releases of a newest specification. So in 2015 they released a `ECMAScript 2015`, which is also called `ECMAScipt` version **6** 0s **`ES6`**
