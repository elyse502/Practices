# Object-oriented Programming üíª
**Object-oriented Programming** is a programming `paradigm` centered around `objects` rather than functions. **OOP** is `not` a programming language or tool!, it's a style of programming or a programming `paradigm`. There are several `programming languages` out there that support **object-oriented programming** such as **c-sharp**, **Java**, **Ruby**, **Python**, **JavaScript** and more....

`JavaScript` is a little bit controversial!. It may interest you to know that many of the popular `frameworks` out there that you might be using are actually designed with **Object-oriented Programming** concepts in mind. `Angular` is an example of these `frameworks`. So **`Object-oriented Programming`** is a popular style of programming and it comes up in many technical **interviews**, so if you really want to be a `serious developer` you need to understand **`Object-oriented Programming`**.
