# Node JS Tutorial
**`Node Js`** or **`Node`** is an **open source** and **cross-platform** runtime envirnonment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. Quite often we use `node` to build `back-end services` also called `apis` or `application programming interfaces`, these are the `services` that power our `client` **apllications** like a **web app** running inside of a **web browser** or a **mobile app** on a **mobile device**. These `client apps` are simply what the user sees and interact with, They're just the `surface` they need to talk to some `services` sitting on the `server` or in the `cloud` to store **data**, send **emails** or push **notifications**, kick off **workflows**,...

`Node` is ideal for building **Highly-scalable**, **data-intensive** and **real-time apps/back-end sevices** that power our `client applications`. Now you might ask but there are other `tools` and `frameworks` out there for building `back-end` services such as **asp.net**, **rails** **Django**,... So what's special about `Node`?

Well **`Node`** is easy to get started and can be used for `prototyping` and `agile development`, but it can also be used for building `super fast` and `highly scalable` services. It is used in production by large companies such as `PayPal`, `Uber`, `Netlix`, `Walmart`,... So **`Node`** is an excellent choice for building `highly scalable` services, another reason for using **`Node`** is that in old applications we use `JavaScript`, so if you're a **Front-end Developer** and know `JavaScript` you can reuse your `JavaScript skills` and a **Transtion** to a `Full-stack` developer and get a better job with a better pay! You don't have to learn a new `programming language` also because you can use `JavaScript` both on the **Front-end** and on the **Back-end** your `source code` will be cleaner and more consistent, so you will use the same `naming conventions`, the same `tools` and the same `best practices` and finally another reason for using **`Node`** is that it has the largest `ecosystem` of `open source libraries` available to you! So for prettu much any **features** or **building blocks** you want to add to your `application`, there is some free `open source library` out there that you can use. So you don't have to build this `building blocks` from scratch and instead you can focus on the **core** of your `application`.
