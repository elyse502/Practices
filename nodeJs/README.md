# Node JS Tutorial
`Node Js` or `Node` is an **open source** and **cross-platform** runtime envirnonment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. Quite often we use `node` to build `back-end services` also called `apis` or `application programming interfaces`, these are the `services` that power our `client` **apllications** like a **web app** running inside of a **web browser** or a **mobile app** on a **mobile device**. These `client apps` are simply what the user sees and interact with, They're just the `surface` they need to talk to some `services` sitting on the `server` or in the `cloud` to store **data**, send **emails** or push **notifications**, kick off **workflows**,...

Well **Node** is easy to get started and can be used for `prototyping` and `agile development`, but it can also be used for building `super fast` and `highly scalable` services. It is used in production by large companies such as `PayPal`, `Uber`, `Netlix`, `Walmart`,...
